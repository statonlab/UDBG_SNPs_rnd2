4 subdirectories: 15_2n, 15_3n, 15_4n, and 15_CH_TE_MV_3n, were used to calculate SNPs among respective groupings.

The zDev_SNV_pooled.py and zDev_submit.sh scripts are used to do this. zDev_SNV_pooled.py calls modules from zDev_SNV_modules.py in order to filter by coverage and report locations with adequate coverage and differing genotypes among cultivars. The results are reported int a .tsv file.
